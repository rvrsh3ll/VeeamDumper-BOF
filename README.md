## Veeam Dumper BOF

A credential extraction BOF for Veeam Backup and Replication and Veeam One by Stephen Munro and Logan Kroeger from @MWRCyberSec. The BOF needs to be executed in an Admin beacon on either a Veeam One or Veeam Backup and Replication server and supports Cobalt Strike and Outflank C2.

```
tldr;
The BOF uses sqlcmd.exe/psql.exe to extract encrypted credential blobs from the database, grabs the salt from regisry and uses DPAPI to decrypt and print them.
```

I am not a skilled C developer, so I strongly suggest spawning a second beacon to run this BOF as a precaution if you are worried about the beacon crashing. I have tested against Veeam One and Veeam Backup and Replication for both PSQL and MSSQL and all of them worked.
<!-- There is also a standalone .Net implementation coming soon: https://github.com/MWR-CyberSec/ -->

	 db type (Required):	mssql, psql, auto 
	 --dbname (Optional):	if blank will try pull from registry. 
	 --exepath (Optional):	Path to sqlcmd.exe/psql.exe. If not specified will search $PATH and common locations depending on the DB type 
	 --debug (Optional):	Enables debug output
	 --veeamone (Optional):	Run VeeamOne mode

Examples:
	 veeam-dumper auto
